    <h2 style="color:#2c3e50; font-size:2.3rem; margin-bottom:20px;">Wine country tours</h2>
    <p>Rolling vineyards stretched for miles under a soft sun. Wine Country Tours is about slowing down — about savoring not just flavors, but conversations, stories, and the quiet charm of countryside life.</p>

    <p>Each glass tells a story of the land, the climate, the patience it takes to grow something worth toasting to. It’s not about drinking — it’s about celebrating every detail.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#2c3e50;">Unmissable Moments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sunset tastings in Napa Valley</li>
      <li>Wineries on bike trails in South Australia</li>
      <li>Cheese and Bordeaux in a French château</li>
      <li>Chianti among olive trees in Tuscany</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color:#2c3e50;">Local Culture & Food</h3>
    <p>Locals speak of their vines like family. Harvests are celebrated like holidays. Meals are slow — rustic bread, fresh olives, and hearty pastas shared in open-air patios with laughter echoing across fields.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#2c3e50;">A Moment I’ll Never Forget</h3>
    <p>In Santorini, I shared a bottle with a vineyard owner whose vines had been planted by his grandfather. As the sun dipped behind the cliffs, we clinked glasses over generations of love for land and life.</p>
