  <h1 class="mb-3">Coastal Getaway: Sun, Sand, and Serenity</h1>

  <p>There’s a certain kind of peace that only the ocean can bring. The sound of waves gently lapping against the shore, warm sand beneath your feet, and sunsets that paint the sky in brilliant shades of orange and pink. This coastal escape took me on a journey through some of the world's most beautiful seaside destinations, offering everything from tranquil beaches to vibrant island towns.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Maldives: Paradise Perfected</h3>
  <p>The Maldives is every beach lover’s dream — powdery white sands, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and overwater bungalows that seem to float on an endless blue canvas. Days here were spent snorkeling among colorful reefs, kayaking in lagoons, and lounging on sun-soaked decks with fresh coconut in hand.</p>
  <p>Evenings brought candlelit dinners on the beach and stargazing sessions under a canopy of shimmering stars, unspoiled by city lights.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Goa, India: Where Culture Meets Coast</h3>
  <p>Goa is a unique blend of laid-back beaches and colonial charm. From the lively shores of Baga and Anjuna to the quiet sands of Palolem, every beach has its own vibe. Morning yoga sessions, flea markets, seafood shacks, and live music by bonfires made this stop both energetic and deeply relaxing.</p>
  <p>Don't miss the legendary <strong>Goan fish curry</strong>, best enjoyed with sunset views at a seaside café.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Santorini, Greece: Clifftop Magic</h3>
  <p>Perched on volcanic cliffs, the whitewashed villages of Santorini overlook the deep blue Aegean Sea. Winding cobbled streets lead to hidden chapels and cliffside tavernas. I spent my afternoons hiking along the caldera rim and my evenings watching the famous sunset from Oia, as the sun dipped beneath the horizon in a blaze of crimson and gold.</p>
  <p>The local cuisine — especially the grilled octopus and fava puree — was as spectacular as the scenery.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Coastal Travel Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pack reef-safe sunscreen to protect marine life.</li>
    <li>Always check tide schedules when visiting isolated beaches.</li>
    <li>Carry a waterproof bag for your gadgets and valuables.</li>
    <li>Try local seafood specialties at small, family-run eateries.</li>
    <li>Wake early for peaceful beach walks before the crowds arrive.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Final Reflections</h3>
  <p>Each destination on this coastal getaway offered something unique — the luxury and tranquility of the Maldives, the vibrant charm of Goa, and the romantic beauty of Santorini. Together, they reminded me that sometimes the best therapy is saltwater — whether in the form of sea, sweat, or tears of joy as you witness another perfect sunset over the water.</p>
