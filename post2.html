  <h1 class="mb-3">Tastes of Asia: A Street Food Journey</h1>

  <p>Few things capture the heart and culture of a place quite like its street food. Vibrant markets filled with sizzling woks, fragrant spices, and colorful dishes are at the center of daily life across Asia. On this trip, I embarked on a culinary pilgrimage through Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia, tasting everything from piping-hot satays to sweet coconut desserts.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Thailand: The Night Markets of Bangkok</h3>
  <p>Our journey began in Bangkok's legendary night markets. As dusk settled, streets lit up with neon signs and the aroma of grilled meats, garlic, and fresh herbs filled the air. From the famous <strong>Pad Thai</strong> cooked in enormous woks to deep-fried insects for the brave-hearted, the variety was endless.</p>
  <p>My personal favorites were crispy mango sticky rice, spicy papaya salad, and skewers of marinated pork. Vendors proudly shared recipes passed down through generations, and you could taste the authenticity in every bite.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Vietnam: Pho Mornings and Coffee Culture</h3>
  <p>In Hanoi, mornings begin with the wafting scent of simmering <strong>Pho</strong> — Vietnam’s beloved rice noodle soup. Each bowl brims with rich broth, tender beef, and fresh herbs. Sidewalk vendors serve it up with baskets of bean sprouts, chili slices, and lime wedges.</p>
  <p>Afternoons were reserved for Vietnamese iced coffee, brewed in a slow-drip filter called a <em>phin</em>. Strong and bold, it’s poured over condensed milk and ice, a perfect remedy for the humid heat.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4">Malaysia: A Melting Pot of Flavors</h3>
  <p>Malaysia’s street food reflects its multicultural roots — a fusion of Malay, Chinese, and Indian influences. At Kuala Lumpur’s bustling <em>Jalan Alor</em>, stalls stretched as far as the eye could see. I sampled satay skewers with peanut sauce, spicy <strong>char kway teow</strong>, and <strong>roti canai</strong> served with curry.</p>
  <p>One unforgettable evening, I joined a communal seafood dinner under string lights, feasting on chili crab and butter prawns as local musicians played traditional instruments.</p>
