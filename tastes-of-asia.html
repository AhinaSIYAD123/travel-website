<h2 style="color:#2c3e50; font-size:2.3rem; margin-bottom:20px;">Tastes of Asia</h2>
  <p>The air was thick with the scent of sizzling spices, sweet mangoes, and smoky grilled meats. Every turn down a bustling Asian street revealed something new: vendors frying dumplings in old cast-iron pans, carts brimming with tropical fruits, and open-air kitchens whipping up steaming bowls of noodles in seconds.</p>

  <p>Asia’s cuisine isn’t just food — it’s an experience that invades every sense. From delicate Japanese sushi to fiery Thai curries and rich Indian biryanis, every dish tells a story of centuries-old traditions.</p>

  <h3 style="color:#2c3e50;">Unmissable Flavors</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Street-side pad Thai with crushed peanuts and lime in Bangkok</li>
    <li>Freshly steamed bao buns in Shanghai’s old quarters</li>
    <li>Fragrant masala chai at dawn in Jaipur</li>
    <li>Grilled satay skewers dipped in spicy peanut sauce in Bali</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#2c3e50;">Local Culture & Food</h3>
