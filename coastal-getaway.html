  <p>The gentle waves rolled in, chasing my footprints in the wet sand. Palm trees swayed like they had their own secret rhythm, and the scent of saltwater mixed with grilled seafood from a nearby shack. This was more than a destination — it was where the world slowed down, and simple things became unforgettable moments.</p>

  <p>Every sunrise felt like a promise, and every sunset painted stories across the sky. Mornings began with seashell hunts, afternoons melted into hammock naps, and evenings meant music by the fire and stories shared with strangers who felt like old friends.</p>

  <h3 style="color:#2c3e50;">Unmissable Experiences:</h3>

    <li>Stroll barefoot along the shore at dawn</li>
